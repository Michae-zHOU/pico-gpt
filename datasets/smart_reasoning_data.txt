Problem: If a train travels 240 km in 3 hours, what is its average speed?
Solution: Speed = Distance ÷ Time = 240 km ÷ 3 hours = 80 km/h

Problem: A recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for 12 cookies. How much flour is needed for 18 cookies?
Solution: Set up a proportion: 2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 18 cookies
Cross multiply: 12x = 36, so x = 3 cups of flour needed

Problem: Debug this Python code that should find the maximum value in a list:
def find_max(numbers):
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num < max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

Solution: The bug is in the comparison. It should be "if num > max_val" not "if num < max_val":
def find_max(numbers):
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

Problem: Plan a weekly schedule for someone learning Python programming (2 hours daily).
Solution: 
Monday: Python basics - variables, data types (2h)
Tuesday: Control structures - if/else, loops (2h) 
Wednesday: Functions and modules (2h)
Thursday: Data structures - lists, dictionaries (2h)
Friday: File handling and error management (2h)
Weekend: Practice project - build a simple calculator

Problem: How can I optimize this slow database query?
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25 AND city = 'New York' ORDER BY name;

Solution: 
1. Add indexes: CREATE INDEX idx_age_city ON users(age, city);
2. Add index for sorting: CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
3. Select only needed columns instead of *
4. Consider limiting results if not all are needed

Problem: Explain why this logic is flawed: "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore penguins can fly."
Solution: This is a logical fallacy due to an incorrect premise. The statement "All birds can fly" is false - many birds cannot fly (penguins, ostriches, kiwis, etc.). The logical structure is valid (modus ponens) but the conclusion is false because the major premise is incorrect.

Problem: A company's profit increased by 20% last year and 15% this year. What's the total percentage increase?
Solution: Don't just add percentages! Use compound growth:
If original profit = 100, then:
After year 1: 100 × 1.20 = 120
After year 2: 120 × 1.15 = 138
Total increase = 38%, not 35%

Problem: Design a simple algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome.
Solution: Two-pointer approach:
1. Set left pointer at start, right pointer at end
2. Compare characters at both pointers
3. If different, return false
4. Move pointers toward center
5. If they meet/cross, return true

def is_palindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

Problem: Why is my website loading slowly? Users report 5-10 second load times.
Solution: Common causes and fixes:
1. Image optimization - compress large images, use WebP format
2. Minimize HTTP requests - combine CSS/JS files
3. Enable caching - browser and server-side
4. Use CDN for static assets
5. Optimize database queries
6. Enable compression (gzip)
7. Check hosting server performance

Problem: Solve this step by step: 2x + 5 = 3x - 7
Solution:
Step 1: Move variables to one side: 2x - 3x = -7 - 5
Step 2: Simplify: -x = -12  
Step 3: Multiply by -1: x = 12
Step 4: Check: 2(12) + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29, and 3(12) - 7 = 36 - 7 = 29 ✓

Problem: My Python program keeps crashing with "IndexError: list index out of range". How do I fix this?
Solution: This error occurs when accessing a list index that doesn't exist. Prevention strategies:
1. Check list length: if len(my_list) > index:
2. Use try/except: 
   try:
       value = my_list[index]
   except IndexError:
       print("Index not found")
3. Use safe methods like .get() for dictionaries
4. Validate input ranges before using as indices

Problem: Calculate the area of a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5.
Solution: This is a right triangle (3² + 4² = 5²), so:
Area = ½ × base × height = ½ × 3 × 4 = 6 square units

Alternative using Heron's formula:
s = (3+4+5)/2 = 6
Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = √[6×3×2×1] = √36 = 6

Problem: Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
Solution:
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn patterns
- Has input-output pairs for training
- Goal: predict outputs for new inputs  
- Examples: email spam detection, image classification

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Only has input data, no target outputs
- Goal: discover hidden structures
- Examples: customer segmentation, data compression

Problem: Why isn't my CSS working? The text color won't change.
Solution: Common CSS debugging steps:
1. Check selector specificity - more specific rules override general ones
2. Verify correct property names (color vs colour)
3. Check for typos in class/ID names
4. Use browser dev tools to inspect applied styles
5. Ensure CSS file is properly linked in HTML
6. Check for conflicting styles or !important declarations

Problem: A password must be 8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Validate this: "MyPass123"
Solution: Analysis of "MyPass123":
✓ 8+ characters (9 characters)
✓ Uppercase letters (M, P)  
✓ Lowercase letters (y, a, s, s)
✓ Numbers (1, 2, 3)
✗ Symbols (none present)
Result: Invalid - missing required symbols

Problem: Optimize this inefficient code:
total = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += i

Solution: Mathematical approach is much faster:
# Sum of even numbers from 0 to n-1 where n=1000000
# Even numbers: 0, 2, 4, ..., 999998
# This is arithmetic series: sum = count × (first + last) / 2
count = 500000  # half of 1000000
total = count * (0 + 999998) // 2 = 249999500000

Problem: Explain why correlation doesn't imply causation with an example.
Solution: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer, showing strong correlation. However:
- Ice cream doesn't cause drowning
- Drowning doesn't cause ice cream sales  
- The real cause is warm weather (confounding variable)

This shows correlation can exist without causation due to hidden variables, reverse causation, or pure coincidence.

Problem: How do I structure a research paper effectively?
Solution: Standard academic structure:
1. Title - clear and descriptive
2. Abstract - 150-250 word summary
3. Introduction - background and thesis
4. Literature Review - existing research
5. Methodology - how you conducted research  
6. Results - findings and data
7. Discussion - interpretation of results
8. Conclusion - key takeaways
9. References - cited sources

Problem: Debug this SQL query that returns no results:
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary = '50000';

Solution: The issue is likely data type mismatch. If salary is stored as a number, don't use quotes:
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary = 50000;

Also check:
- Table/column names are correct
- Data actually exists in that range
- No leading/trailing spaces in data

Problem: Convert 75°F to Celsius and explain the formula.
Solution: Formula: C = (F - 32) × 5/9
C = (75 - 32) × 5/9 = 43 × 5/9 = 215/9 ≈ 23.89°C

The formula works because:
- Subtract 32 to adjust for different zero points
- Multiply by 5/9 to convert scale ratio (9°F = 5°C)

Problem: My website looks different on mobile vs desktop. How do I fix responsive design issues?
Solution: Key responsive design principles:
1. Use viewport meta tag: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
2. CSS media queries for different screen sizes
3. Flexible layouts with percentages/flexbox/grid
4. Scalable images: max-width: 100%
5. Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
6. Test on actual devices or browser dev tools

Problem: Calculate compound interest: $1000 invested at 5% annually for 3 years.
Solution: Formula: A = P(1 + r)^t
Where: P=$1000, r=0.05, t=3
A = 1000(1 + 0.05)^3 = 1000(1.05)^3 = 1000 × 1.157625 = $1157.63
Interest earned = $1157.63 - $1000 = $157.63

Problem: Why does my code work on my computer but not in production?
Solution: Common environment differences:
1. Different versions (Python, libraries, OS)
2. Missing dependencies - use requirements.txt
3. Environment variables not set
4. File path differences (Windows vs Linux)
5. Database connection settings
6. Permissions issues
7. Configuration differences

Best practices: Use containers (Docker) or virtual environments for consistency.
