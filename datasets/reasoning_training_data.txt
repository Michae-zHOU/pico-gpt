Human: A farmer has chickens and cows. In total there are 50 heads and 140 legs. How many chickens and how many cows are there?
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step:

Let's say:
- c = number of chickens
- w = number of cows

Setting up equations:
- Total heads: c + w = 50
- Total legs: 2c + 4w = 140 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

From the first equation: c = 50 - w

Substituting into the second equation:
2(50 - w) + 4w = 140
100 - 2w + 4w = 140
100 + 2w = 140
2w = 40
w = 20

Therefore: c = 50 - 20 = 30

Answer: There are 30 chickens and 20 cows.

Check: 30 + 20 = 50 heads ✓, (30 × 2) + (20 × 4) = 60 + 80 = 140 legs ✓
